> 1wallet is designed for people who want the best and the latest from the world of crypto, but do not want to deal with senseless "mnemonic words", "private keys", or "seed phrases"

You don't need to be technical to use 1wallet. It is:

Simple: to create a wallet, just scan a QR code using the Google Authenticator app

Secure: authorize transactions with 6-digit code from Google Authenticator. No private keys or passwords to take care of.

Durable: easily restore wallet by scanning QR code exported by Google Authenticator, or recover funds using another wallet.

Smart: configurable spending limit, composable security, and auto-recover mechanisms. Imagine a (physical) wallet that has an embedded computer - it can do a lot more than a plain old wallet that only carries your money around.
